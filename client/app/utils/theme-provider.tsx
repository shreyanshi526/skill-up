// export function ThemeProvider ({children, ...props}: ThemeProviderProps) { ... }: This declares a functional component named ThemeProvider. It takes in props, including the children prop, which represents the nested components within the ThemeProvider.

// ThemeProviderProps is used as the type for the props to ensure that the component receives the expected properties.

// The {...props} syntax spreads the remaining props (excluding children) to the NextThemeProvider component.

// The component returns the NextThemeProvider component with the spread props and nested children components.
